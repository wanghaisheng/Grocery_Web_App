## Steps to Run the Application Locally

Follow these steps to set up the application on your local machine

### 1. Clone the Repository

bash
    git clone https://github.com/dk172923/online-learning-platform.git


### 2. Navigate to the cloned repository

bash 
    cd online-learning-platform


### 3. Configuration Settings
Rename the environment file in the client side.
bash
    Rename .env.local1 to .env.local


### 4. Setting up the frontend
Open a new terminal in VS Code and run the following commands to install the required packages and start the frontend

bash
    cd Client
    npm install   # install the required packages
    npm run dev

Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 to access the frontend of the application.

### 5. Setting up the backend
Open another terminal in VS Code and run the following commands to install the necessary packages and start the backend server

bash 
    cd server
