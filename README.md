```

### 4. Setting up the frontend
Open a new terminal in VS Code and run the following commands to install the required packages and start the frontend

```bash
    cd client
    npm install   # install the required packages
    npm run dev
```

Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the frontend of the application.
